# AsciiFarter 2
###### Release version `2.2` alpha
###### Document revision from `02.20.2026`

### "2"? what? theres a first one?
Yes, and its available at [yeetshttps/asciiFarter](https://github.com/yeetshttps/asciiFarter/)

### What does it do?
AsciiFarter takes Ascii Art from [a website](https://yeetssite.github.io/asciifarter/asciiArt/) and prints it in your terminal.

It does this by looking at a file named [`status.xml`](https://yeetshttps.github.io/asciiFarter/status.xml) and uses the information from the file to get a list of URLs for Ascii Arts and other various info.

AsciiFarter 2 is designed to be able to be integrated in things like Discord bots or other random scripts, see [`source/fartlib/README.md`](./source/fartlib/README.md) for more info about this.

### How do I use it?
To run, AsciiFarter needs the Python modules `bs4`(BeatifulSoup) and `lxml` installed. This should usually be as easy as running pip to install them:

```bash
pip3 install bs4 lxml
```

##### Getting AsciiFarter on your system so you can run it 
Right now, you can only run it by cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeetssite/asciifarter.git
```

Hopefully, if I remember, there will eventually be an installer script that lets you actually install AsciiFarter to run it outside of the repo.

##### To run AsciiFarter from the repo

Go to the folder with AsciiFarter in it:

```bash
cd ./asciifarter/source/
```

Then, run AsciiFarter:

```bash
python ./asciiFarter2.py
```

##### What AsciiFarter will do

By default, AsciiFarter prints a random Ascii Art when you run it. To view what AsciiFarter can do, run:

```bash
~/$ python ./asciifarter/source/asciiFarter2.py help
```
