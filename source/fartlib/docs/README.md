# fartlib - documentation
This folder contains all the current documentation for `fartlib`. Currently, the documentation is limited to the reference(`fartlib/docs/reference.md`) and the information in the README of this module (`fartlib/README.md`), and may become outdated. 

I will do my best to keep these docs accurate/uptodate as `fartlib` is updated but nothing is garunteed as this is a solo development project made for fun.
